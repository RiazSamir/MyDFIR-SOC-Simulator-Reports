# MyDFIR-SOC-Simulator-Reports

This repository contains structured investigation reports based on simulated security alerts from the MYDFIR SOC Simulator environment. The goal is to replicate real Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows by analyzing alerts in Microsoft Defender XDR and related telemetry sources, then producing professional incident reports.

**⚠️All scenarios represent controlled, training-based attack simulations, not real production incidents.⚠️**

## Purpose

- This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Investigate security alerts using XDR telemetry
- Correlate endpoint, identity, and email activity
- Extract indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Assess impact and risk
- It reflects practical SOC analyst tasks, including triage, evidence gathering, root cause analysis, and reporting.
